# 3.16 日志和调试

All DOMjudge daemons and web interface scripts support logging and debugging in a uniform manner via functions in lib.error.\*. There are three ways in which information is logged:

- Directly to stderr for daemons or to the web page for web interface scripts (the latter only on serious issues).
- To a log file set by the variable LOGFILE, which is set in each program. Unsetting this variable disables this method.
- To syslog. This can be configured via the SYSLOG configuration variable in etc/common-config.php. This option gives the flexibility of syslog, such as remote logging. See the syslog(daemon) documentation for more information. Unsetting this variable disables this method.

Each script also defines a default threshold level for messages to be logged to stderr (VERBOSE: defaults to `LOG_INFO` in daemons and `LOG_ERR` in the web interface) and for log file/syslog (LOGLEVEL: defaults to `LOG_DEBUG`).

In case of problems, it is advisable to check the logs for clues. Extra debugging information can be obtained by setting the config option DEBUG to a bitwise-or of the available `DEBUG_*` flags in etc/common-config.php, to e.g. generate extra SQL query and timing information in the web interface.
