# 3.14 警报系统

DOMjudge includes an alerting system. This allows the administrator to receive alerts when important system events happen, e.g. an error occurs, or a submission or judging is made.

These alerts are passed to a plugin script `alert` which can easily be adapted to fit your needs. The default script emits different beeping sounds for the different messages when the beep program is available, but it could for example also be modified to send a mail on specific issues, connect to monitoring software like Nagios, etc. For more details, see the script `lib/alert`
