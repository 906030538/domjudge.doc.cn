Compilers can be configured by creating or selecting/editing an executable in the web interface. When compiling a set of source files, the run executable is invoked with the following arguments: destination file name, memory limit (in KB), main (first) source file, other source files. For more information, see for example the executables `c` or `java_javac_detect` in the web interface. **Note**: that compile scripts are included for most common languages already.

Interpreted languages and non-statically linked binaries (for example, `Oracle Java`) can in principle also be used, but require that all runtime dependencies are added to the chroot environment. See section <a href="3.7-installation-of-a-judgehost.md#chroot">creating a chroot environment </a>.

Interpreted languages do not generate an executable and in principle do not need a compilation step. However, to be able to use interpreted languages (also `Oracle's Java`), during the compilation step a script must be generated that will function as the executable: the script must run the interpreter on the source. See for example `pl` and `java_javac_detect` in the list of executables.
