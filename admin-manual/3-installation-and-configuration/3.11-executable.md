# 3.11 可执行文件

DOMjudge supports executable archives (uploaded and stored in ZIP format) for configuration of languages, special run and compare programs. The archive must contain an executable file named `build` or `run`. When deploying a new (or changed) executable to a judgehost build is executed *once* if present. Afterwards an executable file run must exist (it may have existed before), that is called to execute the compile, compare, or run script. The specific formats are detailed below.

Executables may be changed via the web interface in an online editor or by uploading a replacement zip file. Changes apply immediately to all further uses of that executable.
