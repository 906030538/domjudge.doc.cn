# 3.19 更新

There is some support to upgrade DOMjudge to newer versions. Note that this functionality is not extensively tested, so when you plan to upgrade, you are strongly advised to backup the DOMjudge database and other data before continuing. We also advise to check the ChangeLog file for important changes.

Upgrading the filesystem installation is probably best done by installing the new version of DOMjudge in a separate place and transferring the configuration settings from the old version.

There are SQL upgrade scripts to transform the database including its data to the layout of a newer version. The scripts can be found under sql/upgrade and each script applies changes between two consecutive DOMjudge versions. At the beginning of each script, a check is performed which will let MySQL bail out with an error if it should not be applied anymore. Note that the scripts must be applied in order (sorted by release). These scripts can be applied by running `dj_setup_database` upgrade. Be aware that these scripts are conservative in adding and upgrading SQL data, so check that e.g. new compile scripts are present or add them manually, and check the upgrade scripts manually for any other data upgraded.
