# 3.15 其他可配置脚本

There are a few more places where some configuration of the system can be made. These are sometimes needed in non-standard environments.

- In `bin/dj_make_chroot` on a judgehost some changes to variables can be made, most notably DEBMIRROR to select a Debian mirror site near you.
- The script `lib/judge/chroot-startstop.sh` can be modified to suit your local environment. See comments in that file for more information.
